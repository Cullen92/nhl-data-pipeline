# THRESHOLD GUIDANCE FOR NHL DATA:
# - Regular season day: ~5-15 games = ~400-1200 player stats
# - Busy day: 15+ games = ~1800+ player stats
# - Playoffs: More frequent games
# 
# Row count can naturally vary 50-100% day-to-day based on schedule!
# Set thresholds based on your lookback window and deployment frequency.

row_count_threshold: 0.50  # Alert if row count changes >50% (accounts for busy vs slow game days)
null_threshold: 0.05  # Alert if null counts change >5% (critical IDs should stay at 0 nulls)

# NOTE: Only check columns for nulls where nulls indicate DATA QUALITY ISSUES.
# - DO check: Critical IDs (game_id, player_id, team_id) - should never be null
# - DON'T check: Stat columns (goals, assists, TOI) - nulls are expected when players don't play
